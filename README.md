**Data Munging**
We started by pulling weekly top 200 charts from various regions from spotify's top streaming charts.





We utilized Bootstrap to build out our index.html file for the dashboard layout with the drop down coded in. After builing the index.html, we created our css file to bring in the styling for the header and left rail text boxes and drop down. 

We built a bar and bubble chart using D3 JSON to bring in the data from our app.py file and extract it out for our region-changing data use.
