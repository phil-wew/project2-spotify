We utilized Bootstrap to build out our index.html file for the dashboard layout with the drop down coded in. After building the index.html, we created our css file to bring in the styling for the header and left rail text boxes and drop down. 

We built a bar and bubble chart using D3 JSON to bring in the data from our app.py file and extract it out for our region-changing data use. 







Based on the data gathered and analyzed, it was determined that Pop music is the most popular in Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Great Britain & Switzerland. Latin music was found to be the most popular music in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia & Globally. From our analysis, something we found quite interesting is that people in Canada and the U.S. prefer to listen to Adult Standard "Oldies" music rather Pop or Latin music.
