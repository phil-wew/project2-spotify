We utilized Bootstrap to build out our index.html file for the dashboard layout with the drop down coded in. After building the index.html, we created our css file to bring in the styling for the header and left rail text boxes and drop down. 

We built a bar and bubble chart using D3 JSON to bring in the data from our app.py file and extract it out for our region-changing data use. 







Based on the data gathered and analyzed, it was determined that Pop music is the most popular in Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Great Britain & Switzerland. Latin music was found to be the most popular music in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia & Globally. From our analysis, something we found quite interesting is that people in Canada and the U.S. prefer to listen to Adult Standard "Oldies" music rather Pop or Latin music. 



For a third visual we decided that a map would be a good visual to represent the popular music around the world. Originally we wanted to map the top descriptions for each country (ie. danceability, liveness, etc.) in order to compare the countries to each other. However, getting the data to function how we wanted proved to be difficult. In the end we had to settle for using the CSV's of the countries we were able to gather the data on and find the top five songs for the year 2019. Although we had access to way more countries than what is displayed we decided to only show the points that actually had data.
